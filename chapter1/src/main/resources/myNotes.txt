@Autowire - Springs interface
1. it searches by type
2. if the bean with same type does not exist then NoSuchBeanDefinitionException is thrown
3. if more than one bean with the same type exist then also NoSuchBeanDefinitionException is thrown
4. if @qualifier is used then it is used in case there are more than one bean with same type exist.
5. multiple @qualifiers can be used in complex examples. 
 	like bean with same type and same @qualifier exist then we add one more @qualifier as differentiator and so on
6. it is not useful when we want to inject something like util:map
	For this we have to use Resource
7. it is used in case bean injection is optional by using @required=false	
8. in case of @Qualifier, the beans are searched first by type and then @Qualifier is used to narrow down the search.
	If only one bean with the given type exist, then @Qualified never gets used.

@Inject - java interface JSR330 - alternate to @Autowire
1. It is almost same as @Autowire with few differences
2. It does not have @required attribute, instead it has Providers to make the beans optional.
3. Here @Named can be used instead of @Qualifier. 
4. when we specify @Named, the bean is searched by ID straight away. Spring does not search by type at all.
5. only @Named cannot be used to inject the Bean
Note: @Named also is equivalent to @Component when used at the top of class.
	
@Resource - java Annotation
1. the bean is resolved "byName" semantics
2. if 'name' attribute is not provided then bean name is derived from field name
3. if the bean with given does not exist, 'byType' is used  
4. util:map like things can be injected only through @Resource
5. it does not require 'Qualifier' or 'Named' as it derived the name from field name in case 'name' is not provided
	 	 	
 	
Difference between ID and Name
1. id and name both should be unique
2. id is xml entity and strictly contains xml id
3. name can contation multiple name to the same bean but it should be unique.
